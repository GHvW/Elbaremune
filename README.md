# Elbaremune
More Extensions for IEnumerable

### Extensions
Extensions added and planned

### Sequence Generation
Other than `Enumerable.Range`, C# doesn't include many ways to generate a Sequence/IEnumerable

Elbaremune includes a few quality of life static methods for generating sequences of values
